Many trading strategies rely on the so-called *Trading indicators* for example the [RSI trading strategy](../documentation/rsi_strategy.md). 

To calculate an indicator you can implement your custom calculations for it and use it for your trading strategies or you could use any of the available modules for the task, one of them being the [Technical Analysis framework](https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ta.html)

Start by importing the necessary modules.

Pandas for data handling:

```py
import pandas as pd
```

The Technical Analysis (TA) framework:
```py
from ta.trend import sma_indicator
```
In this example we will deploy a simple moving average indicator, so rather than importing the entire `ta` library, we import a simple moving average indicator from the "trend" submodule.

!!! warning "Important"

    It is a good practice to assign the simulated MetaTrader5 instance which has similar methods to the native Python API into a separate (easy to remeber) variable. This variable should give us everything we need from the simulated MetaTrader5 instance.

    ```py
    tester = StrategyTester(tester_config=tester_config, mt5_instance=mt5, logging_level=logging.DEBUG)
    sim_mt5 = tester.simulated_mt5 # extract the simulated metatrader5 from the StrategyTester object and assign it to a simple variable
    logger = tester.logger # obtain the logger
    ```

Inside your main function, you want to:

## Copy rates from the simulator using a simulated MetaTrader5 

```py

def on_tick():

    indicator_window = 20
    rates = sim_mt5.copy_rates_from_pos(symbol=symbol, timeframe=timeframe, start_pos=0, count=indicator_window)

    if rates is None or len(rates) < indicator_window: # if no information was found, or less than expected rates were returned
        return # prevent further calculations
```

!!! Tip "Tip"

    When copying rates errors and zero-length data can be returned sometimes due to several reasons such as:

    During the begining of a test, where the simulator is yet to see much data.
    
    For example: Strategy tester's starting date is 01.01.2020, during the simulation (in the first hour and early minutes/seconds) we could request 100 bars in the past (before that time), this would cause all methods that returns past data like "copy_rates" methods to either return `None`, or less data than anticipated.

    To prevent further issues, you should always check if enough data is returned before calculating your indicators.
    ```python
    if rates is None or len(rates) < indicator_window: # if no information was found, or less than expected rates were returned
        return # prevent further calculations
    ```

    **If insufficient data is returned, the function should skip indicator calculation until enough data is obtained.**

## Indicator Calculation

```py
def on_tick():

    indicator_window = 20
    rates = sim_mt5.copy_rates_from_pos(symbol=symbol, timeframe=timeframe, start_pos=0, count=indicator_window)

    if rates is None or len(rates) < indicator_window: # if no information was found, or less than expected rates were returned
        return # prevent further calculations

    rates_df = pd.DataFrame(data=rates)

    sma_indicator_values = sma_indicator(rates_df["close"], window=indicator_window)

    logger.info(f"Current sma({indicator_window}) : {sma_indicator_values.iloc[-1]}") # print the last calculated value in the array
```

Example outputs:

```bash

## TL;DR

Below is the full script:
```py
import logging
from strategytester5.tester import StrategyTester
import MetaTrader5 as mt5
import pandas as pd
from ta.trend import sma_indicator

if not mt5.initialize():
    raise RuntimeError("Failed to initialize mt5.")

tester_config = {
        "bot_name": "Working With Indicators",
        "symbols": ["USDJPY"],
        "timeframe": "H1",
        "start_date": "01.01.2026 00:00",
        "end_date": "27.03.2026 00:00",
        "modelling" : "Open price only",
        "deposit": 1000,
        "leverage": "1:100"
}

tester = StrategyTester(tester_config=tester_config, mt5_instance=mt5, logging_level=logging.DEBUG)
sim_mt5 = tester.simulated_mt5 # extract the simulated metatrader5 from the StrategyTester object and assign it to a simple variable
logger = tester.logger

# ---------------------- inputs ----------------------------

symbol  = tester_config["symbols"][0] # it should be one among the symbols in symbols list from tester.json (config file/dictionary)
timeframe = sim_mt5.TIMEFRAME_H1 # This should be an integer so you should convert timeframe in string into integer

# ---------------------------------------------------------

def on_tick():

    indicator_window = 20
    rates = sim_mt5.copy_rates_from_pos(symbol=symbol, timeframe=timeframe, start_pos=0, count=indicator_window)

    if rates is None or len(rates) < indicator_window: # if no information was found, or less than expected rates were returned
        return # prevent further calculations

    rates_df = pd.DataFrame(data=rates)

    # print(rates_df.head(-10))
    sma_indicator_values = sma_indicator(rates_df["close"], window=indicator_window)

    logger.info(f"Current sma({indicator_window}) : {sma_indicator_values.iloc[-1]}") # print the last calculated value in the array

tester.run(on_tick_function=on_tick) # very important!
```
